# postnord-change-notifier
I've been refreshing Postnord's website all day to find out when my new litter box will arrive. It's getting pretty tiresome, so let's have a console application check for updates instead.

We will accomplish this by checking Postnord's webapi every 10 minute and compare it with the previous result, to see if there has been any changes.
